# <u> Crisis Analysis to an Online Food Delivery Startup </u>
QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup (founded in 2020) that connects 
customers with nearby restaurants and cloud kitchens. 
In June 2025, QuickBite faced a major crisis. A viral social media incident involving food 
safety violations at partner restaurants, combined with a week-long delivery outage during 
the monsoon season, triggered massive customer backlash. Competitors capitalized with 
aggressive campaigns, worsening the situation. <br>

<b>The challenges were severe: </b> <br>
* A large portion of active users disengaged within a short period. 
* Daily orders saw a sharp decline compared to earlier months. 
* Customer satisfaction scores fell sharply, signaling trust issues. 
* Many partner restaurants shifted to competing platforms. 
* Customer acquisition costs rose significantly. 

## Analysis :
#### 1. 70% Revenue Collapse : <br>
Between January–May 2025 (Pre-Crisis) and June–September 2025 (Crisis Period) -<br>
* Revenue declined from 37.6M to 10.9M, approximate 71% contraction.
* Order volumes dropped consistently across all Tier-1 cities.
* City-level order decline ranged from 68% to 71%, indicating the issue was systemic and not confined to a specific geography.

This consistency suggests platform-wide operational stress rather than isolated underperformance.

#### 2. Operational Breakdown : <br>
* Operational KPIs revealed the root tension, a 50% increase in delivery time combined with a 70% drop in SLA compliance signals severe last-mile inefficiencies.
* When SLA collapses to 12%, customer experience inevitably suffers.

#### 3. Cancellation Trends : <br>
Across major cities, cancellation rates nearly doubled or tripled. <br>

<b>Example: </b><br>
  * Ahmedabad: 1.7% → 4.48% <br>
  * Pune: 1.55% → 3.75% <br>
  
This indicates rising friction between order placement and fulfillment.<br>
Cancellations are often a leading indicator of deeper operational failure i.e, when customers no longer trust successful delivery.

#### 4. Customer Experience : <br>
When operational metrics worsened, Monthly ratings reveal a sharp drop beginning June 2025
  - Pre-crisis ratings averaged ~4.5–4.7
  - Crisis ratings dropped to ~2.3–2.7 <br>
            <br>  <b> Operational disruption → Delivery delays → Customer dissatisfaction </b> <br>
              
This suggests customers reacted immediately to reliability breakdown.

##### What Customers Complained About?  <br>
* Sentiment Analysis showed that - 
* Food quality not good
* Stale food served
* Food safety issues
* Terrible hygiene
* Very late delivery
* Cold food
* Not worth the price
  
This confirms stress on both: <br>

* Restaurant-side quality control
* Last-mile temperature & timing reliability

##### High-Value Customers Suffered the Most  <br>
Customers with five or more pre-crisis orders, historically engaged users, stopped ordering during the crisis. <br>

Top 5% spenders showed:
* Significant order frequency drop
* Severe rating deterioration
* Delivery delays exceeding 20–40 minutes in some cases <br>

This indicates operational failures disproportionately impacted premium customers — those with the highest expectations. <br>

Protecting this segment should have been a strategic priority during instability.

<br>
This was not merely a demand contraction. It was an operational resilience failure.

## Conclusion :
To prevent recurrence: <br>
* Reinforce SLA recovery systems
* Introduce priority protection for top 5% customers
* Improve restaurant quality monitoring
* Implement real-time cancellation alerts
* Track sentiment keywords weekly

High-density cities like Ahmedabad, Pune, and Hyderabad should receive targeted operational reinforcement.
